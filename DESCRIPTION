Description: This package requires a regalOGR object. With this, a target column and a label column it will quickly create a choropleth map of your data! The binning is done by quantiles. The map itself is a product of leaflet. A smoothFactor of 0.3 is used as well as a fillOpacity of one. The aim here is to enable R newcomers and veterans alike to create choropleth maps for EDA in seconds.
